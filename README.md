# CauldronInteract

CauldronInteract is a simple 1.17 plugin, which enables dispensers to interact with cauldrons. Dispensers can use buckets to fill or empty a cauldron. Bottles are currently not supported.

## Use case

A possible use for this plugin would be an integration into an automatic lava farm using the new dripstone blocks. This would allow dispensers to empty the cauldrons and fill chests with lava buckets.

## Installation

The installation is fairly straightforward. Download the plugin from the  [releases tab](https://github.com/VoxCrafterLP/CauldronInteract/releases) and put the .jar file into the plugins folder. Make sure that you are using a 1.17+ server.
